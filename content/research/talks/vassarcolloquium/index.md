title: Classification Theory and the Map of the Universe

event: Vassar Math Colloquium

abstract: 'Model theory enables us to analyze the complexity of various mathematical objects that are structurally very different, such as a graph with a group or a field with a topological space. In this talk we will discuss what it means for a mathematical object to be classifiable and some indicators of complexity that show when an object is not classifiable. We will also take a look at the model-theoretic "map of the universe," which is a means of visually organizing various types of mathematical objects according to model-theoretic degrees of complexity.'
