title: Approximable Structures

event: CT Logic Seminar 

abstract: 'In her graduate thesis, Gwyneth Harrison-Shermoen developed an abstract framework for approximating structures of a given theory, which generalized the notion of smoothly approximable structures. At the time it was unclear how broadly the framework applied due to a lack of examples. In this talk we will discuss how several well-understood NSOP_1 theories are in fact approximable via this framework, and what structural properties we may or may not be able to conclude from such an approximation.'
